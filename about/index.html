		<h2> About Me</h2>

		<p>My name is Joseph Mullen and I was born in Orlando, Florida where I lived until I was five. Once I turned five my family and I moved to the east coast in a town called Melbourne, Florida. I went to Melbourne High School where I played football and basketball. Sports have always been a big part of my life and they continue to be today as I play intramurals and watch them in my free time. While I'm not participating or watching sports in my free time I also enjoy working out and reading.</p>

		<p>I currently am a Junior at the University of Florida working to get my degree in Computer Engineering. I hope to one day work for a company that makes huge technological differences across the country. Something that peeks my interest would be helping to create new technology for the military while working for the government. 
		</p>

		<p>I have an ongoing internship with a small software engineering company in Melbourne. Here I have helped develop in-house programs and some mobile applications. I hope to continue to gain more experience whether with the same company or to branch out to a bigger company.</p>
